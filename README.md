# Node.js MySQL Application

## Installation

1. **Install Node.js:** Download and install Node.js from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Initialize your Node.js project:** Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it using your terminal. Then run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project:

    ```bash
    npm init -y
    ```

3. **Install MySQL package:** Use npm to install the `mysql` package, which allows interaction with MySQL databases:

    ```bash
    npm install mysql
    ```

## Usage

1. **Create a MySQL database:** Set up a MySQL database and create a table that you'll interact with through your Node.js application.

2. **Write your Node.js application:** Develop your application logic in a JavaScript file (e.g., `app.js`). Connect to your MySQL database using the `mysql` package, perform queries, and handle results accordingly.

3. **Run your Node.js application:** Execute your Node.js application using the `node` command in the terminal. Make sure to navigate to the directory containing your application file (e.g., `app.js`):

    ```bash
    node app.js
    ```

   Ensure that your MySQL server is running and accessible from your Node.js application.
